      <h3>About Me </h3>
      <p>I’m a relentlessly curious problem solver with a passion for turning complex challenges into innovative technical solutions. Over my seven years at Microsoft, I’ve focused on building people-centered products that help our technical organizations innovate alongside strategic customers. Certified as a Scrum Master and Product Owner, I blend agile practices, design thinking and a dash of insufferable optimism to deliver high-quality software that drives value. 
        When I’m not tackling hard problems at work, you’ll find me volunteering to diversify STEM fields, introducing underrepresented communities to opportunities in technology. I especially love working with schools that have plenty of potential but lack resources. 
        Outside of that, I’m a huge fan of conversations that start with “What if?” and usually end with a plan to make it happen.</p>
